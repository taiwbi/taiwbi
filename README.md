# Hi, I'm Taiwbi 👋

I'm a web developer who likes to code in php, javascript, html, css, mysql, python and a little bit of rust. I enjoy making websites and web applications that are fast, responsive and user-friendly. And by user-friendly, I mean friendly to myself, because I'm the one who has to use them most of the time. 😅

## What I do

- I develop Wordpress plugins and themes using php, javascript and css. I have created some awesome plugins and themes that you can check out on my GitHub profile. Some of them are so awesome that they have zero downloads, because no one can handle their awesomeness. 😎
- I use laravel framework to build web applications with php and mysql. Laravel is a great framework that makes web development easy. It also has a lot of features that I don't use, but I like to pretend that I do. 🙃
- I also have some experience with python and rust for backend development and data analysis. Python is a powerful and versatile language that can do almost anything. Rust is a fast and safe language that can do almost nothing. 🤓

## What I'm learning

- I'm currently learning more about web design, UI/UX and accessibility. I want to make my websites and web applications more attractive, intuitive and accessible to everyone. Especially to those who have a sense of humor and appreciate my jokes. 😁
- I'm also interested in exploring new Linux technologies and frameworks such as GTK, GJS, and more. I like to learn new things and challenge myself. And by challenge myself, I mean copy and paste code from ChatGPT and hope it works. 😂

## How to reach me

- You can email me at admin@taiwbi.com. I usually reply within 24 hours, unless I'm busy, lazy or both. Which is most of the time. 😜

## A little more about me

- I'm a friendly but not easy-going person who likes to chat with other developers and learn from them. I also like to help others with their coding problems, as long as they are not too hard or too boring. 😆
- I'm a gamer and I play a lot of video games. Some of my favorites are: Minecraft (Yeaaaah it's only Minecraft). 🎮
